**Optimizing Agriculture with Technology: Introducing AgriDirect**

I'm excited to share my latest open-source project, AgriDirect. It's a comprehensive marketplace platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers.

**Key Features:**
*   **Smart Logistics**: Implements Nearest Neighbor algorithm to optimize delivery routes for farmers.
*   **Trust & Safety**: Secure OTP verification for every delivery to ensure inventory accuracy.
*   **Real-time Experience**: Socket.io powered order updates and chat.

I've made the repository public to help other developers learn about building complex marketplaces. Contributions are welcome!

**Title: I built an Open Source Farm-to-Table Marketplace with Route Optimization (MERN Stack)**

Hey everyone,

I just open-sourced **AgriDirect**, a platform I've been working on to help farmers sell directly to consumers.

**Why I built it:**
To solve the "last mile" delivery problem for small-scale farmers and eliminate middlemen.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, Leaflet Maps
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
*   **Real-time**: Socket.io
*   **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions

**Coolest technical challenge:**
Implementing the route optimization system. I used the Haversine formula and a Nearest Neighbor algorithm to sort delivery stops automatically for farmers.

I'd love your feedback on the code structure or any feature ideas!
